                    <p>Supi and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to report how ad impressions, other uses of ad services and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to this site.</p>
                    <p>Supi currently only uses this data to improve the quality of it's service. This form of analytics allows us to see demographics such as age range and gender that further allow us to customise the design of the site to suit the target audience.</p>
                    <p>Supi may, at any time, choose to include advertising on the site based on these demographics, should the site become popular enough to need some financial help. If this is the case, the ads will use Remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online. Third-party vendors, including Google, may show our ads on sites across the Internet.</p>
